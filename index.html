    <h2>Coding creativity</h2>
    <br/>
    <hr/>
    <h3>I'm an orchestral conductor working in the UK, Canada and NZ, with an interest in software engineering and the intersection of music 
        and digital technology, and the possibilities for heightened creativity in real-world and networked spaces. 
        I'm passionate about smart solutions for a cleaner and fairer world, commissioning new works and skewing society towards seeing 
        the arts as something to do rather than something to consume. 
        I'm a maker, a solutions-strategist, and a champion for kindness.
        <br/><br/>
        I started coding in 2020, with self-directed learning through Udemy, Coursera and freecodecamp, along with developing my own projects. 
        I'm in the Command Shift March 2023 cohort, and ready to kick into another gear!
